# Functions

Items passes into functions are either passed by reference or by copy.  Immutable 
items are passed by copy, whereas mutable items are passed by reference. 

- Immutable: int, float, bool, str, tuple, and unicode
- Mutable: list, set, dict

Items that are passed by reference can be changed in the function, and their changes will persist 
when the function has ended.  Items that are passed by copy will not have their changes persisted.
